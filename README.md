# CGLSP (Continuous Galvanzing Line for Steel Coil Production)

Problem Description in context
Graph theory formulation
Mathematical description of solution
Description of how the algorithm is implemented in code - structure of code base ..
How to setup env to run code
How to run the solver for instances ->  navigate to root CGLSP dir and then run CGLSP.py with problem type arg
Where the results are stored
Work still to be done

Results so far
Problems encountered - GCGLPS_26 can't find tight enough LBs
                    - TSPLIP br17 is solved exactly, but tree grows relatively large
                    - even though optimal solution is found, because branching results in subproblems with very low LB, not feasible sols to CGLSP, only to the relaxation
